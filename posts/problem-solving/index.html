I was given a little over two hours to complete the challenge. Eager to impress, I tried to spin up a React app, which at the time was the latest and greatest front-end js framework at the time (this was before create-react-app was a thing), and Redux because that technology was cool and new. I started drawing up a mockup of the UI and thought:</p><p>&ldquo;This is app is going to look so sick!&rdquo;</p><p>Of course, nothing worked. I ran into the issues trying to sync my front-end with the server, and once I had figured out what the problem was, I ended up with a bunch of redux logic sprinkled all over the app (none of which was actually used). In the end all I had to show for was rendering a checkered board with alternating colors.</p><p>Defeated I told one of my developer friends what happened, and what he asked me I&rsquo;ll never forget the dialog we had after that interview.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Well, they didn&rsquo;t give me enough time to impliment the reduc-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I mean why did you use Redux?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Because&mldr;I-&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why did you even use React? The front end didn&rsquo;t need anything other than an an input field, a submit button and a table of words after the search request.&rdquo;</p><p>When I first started in the industry, I thought the thing that would give me an edge over my competitors was to use the most cutting edge technologies. While there is some truth to this, the conversation I had post interview with my friend taught me that the most important questions an engineer can ever ask is not what technologies are &ldquo;industry standard&rdquo;, or what technologies &ldquo;x big company&rdquo; just released, but what the problem is at hand and what is the simplest way to solve it?</p><p>Can I use React to solve the problem? Probably&mldr;Is it the simplest solution? That depends&mldr;</p><p>In my case, it clearly wasn&rsquo;t because the problem had little to do with the UI of the application, and everything to do with the developing a sensible UX. What makes React an industry standard is that is allows developers to scale large single page applications quickly, and I failed to see that the scope of the problem was small.</p><p>If I could travel back in time to give my younger self advice about working in this industry, I would tell him that no matter what technology he learns, all of it amounts to nothing if his domain knowledge cannot address business concerns. I now work for a startup that depends heavily on engineers to create a product for an older demographic. They don&rsquo;t care if the API is GraphQL or REST. They don&rsquo;t care if the application is built on using blockchain or artificial intelligence. What they do care about is whether or not the application helps them do their jobs well.</p><p>What matters most for engineers is their ability to problem solve. Every framework, library or coding language is an ends to this means. Don&rsquo;t fall into the same mistake I made by trying to impress people with your tech stack. No one is impressed. Instead focus on a business problem, search for a tool you know will work and if none come to mind then learn that new tool everyone has been talking about.</p></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>Â© 2022 Powered by <a href=http://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
